## General Use Instructions

To use the Awin Helper Extention, install the extension from the Google or Microsoft Webstore.

When installed, you'll see the extension in your toolbar or in the extensions submenu. Click the icon to access.

## Features
### Simplified / Tech View
Simplified view is here to show you only the information relevant to a non-technical use case. The most important part of this new view is the integration compatibility check.

### Integration Compatibility Checker
In Simplified View, you’ll now see a to-the-point message if your site is found to be compatible through an available integration platform. If no notable platforms are found, you’ll need to reach out to the relevant Awin Staff for more information on if the site is compatible.

### Clipboard
The Clipboard allows you to store information about your current implementation (or really anything else). 
These sections are pre-configured to help you keep track of a new implementation’s MID, Commission Rate and Network Fees.
The information entered is saved locally on your machine so it will transfer between browser windows and remain after you’ve closed your browser. Close and re-open the extension if you wish to refresh the data.
Clear will clear this data from all fields in this section.

### Site Technology Detection
In the right-pane, you’ll see dynamic panels of the detected site technologies or platforms. Each of these panels will include a general “ease of integration” chip to inform you of the recommended integration route.

When the Awin Mastertag is detected, the attached MID will be displayed in place of an ease chip. If more than one is detected, you may see a “+X” for each additional Mastertag found. Mouse over the listed MID for a list of each of the detected MIDs.

“Restricted URL” means that detection will not run on the current tab. This includes Awin URLs, Chrome and Edge internal URLs and their respective webstores.

### New Implementation
Run this in a NEW browser window. This will open 7 new tabs and may make your display cluttered if in an existing window.
The New Implementation tool will open all necessary browser windows in one click for performing the first-time configuration of a new integration.

Simply enter the client’s MID in the box and click “Go”.

Use of this feature reduces the implementation time cost by ~53% by opening all necessary windows for an integration.
